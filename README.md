# Scene Loader

These scripts demonstrate my contributions to my Game Design and Production class project, where I collaborate with a team of 30 students to develop an engaging and immersive game. Among my contributions are a sophisticated level transition system, which enables players to seamlessly transition between scenes with fluid transitions. I have also incorporated the save system that I designed to store any necessary data.
